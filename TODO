Add to turret build:
- particles
- sounds
- //money--
- fading money subtraction (at node)
- total money lerps one digit at a time to new value(???)
- time++

Add to turret sell:
- particles
- sounds
- money++
- fading money subtraction (at node)
- total money lerps one digit at a time to new value(???)
- time--

Add to enemy killed:
- sounds

Ideas:
- building adds time (cost dependant)
- selling loses time (cost dependant)
- killing increases money (enemy level dependant)
- time gradually decays money (level dependant)
- multi-level
- cash in time for money and vice versa (harder to buy time)
- In-world UI to the right (all but the turret selection)
- Time related things are light blue (laser beam tip, timer, effects)
- Money related things are yellow (enemies, money counter, effects)
- Bad things are red (end goal, wave countdown title)
- cash in the levels can be converted into the menu currency (maybe 1:10) && bought from store
